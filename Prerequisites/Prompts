Review all open files—especially the app description, database schema, and strict rules—since these are critical to our app development. Our app uses Flutter for the front end and Supabase for the back end, and all initial database connections and setups are complete. Identify and fix the issues listed in the file problems.txt (which will be updated with a tree structure at the end). If any necessary files aren’t open, ask me to open them. Then, work through the problems step by step and resolve them.



I have done all the above. now these problems exist figure out why they have cometake into account that the code was changed to what was suggested by you. give full code replacements for each file do not give snippets. All the necessary requested files are open in the workspace now the app description .txt the database schema.txt plan.txt problems.txt specific feature implementations.txt strictrules of text are opened in the workspace take a look at them analyse them and proceed now give correct instructions for fixing the problems
