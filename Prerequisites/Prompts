Review all open files—especially the app description, database schema, and strict rules—since these are critical to our app development. Our app uses Flutter for the front end and Supabase for the back end, and all initial database connections and setups are complete. Identify and fix the issues listed in the file problems.txt (which will be updated with a tree structure at the end). If any necessary files aren’t open, ask me to open them. Then, work through the problems step by step and resolve them.
